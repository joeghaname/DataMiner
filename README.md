# DataMiner
 DataMiner is a project written in Java that contains an command-line interface for two major frequent itemset mining algorithms: A-Priori and PCY. A-Priori and PCY are considered to be efficient and effective frequent itemset mining algorithms and are quite popular and powerful.

Some useful information on A-Priori algorithm can be found [here](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/ch6.pdf "here").

More information on the PCY (Park-Chen-Yu) Algorithm can be found [here](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mining/pdf/assoc-rules2.pdf "here").
